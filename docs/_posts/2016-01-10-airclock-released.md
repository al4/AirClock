After months of sporadic hard work, where I would work on it for a day, drop it for weeks, then promptly forget what the hell I was doing, AirClock is finally on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.al4.airclock). At this stage it is very basic, but with a little bit of luck it will hopefully evolve a little before I head to New Zealand later this year.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for AirClock, please contact me via [email](mailto:airclock@al4.co.nz) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/al4).
