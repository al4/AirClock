Future AirClock features:

Calculate time:

$takeoff_time = absolute takeoff time in UTC
$landing_time = absolute landing time in UTC
$current_time = current time in UTC

$time_shift = difference between source and dest in seconds

$shift_ratio = ($elapsed / $total_flight_time)

$shift_seconds = $time_shift * $shift_ratio

$effective_time = $current_time + $shift_seconds


origin time zone: GMT+1
dest time zone GMT+13
